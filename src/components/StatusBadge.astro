Let's try Rose Pink for now as it fits the palette better, or maybe a custom Green if needed. The user said "Green/Pink", let's use a nice Pink for Found to keep it romantic.
// Actually, for "Found", let's use a distinct color. Maybe a soft Teal/Green that matches the palette.
// But strictly following the prompt: "Found (Green/Pink)". Let's use a Soft Green #06D6A0 is too bright.
// Let's use the Rose Pink #FF4D6D for Found (Success) and Crimson #C9184A for Lost (Urgent).
// Wait, user said "Found (Green/Pink)". I will stick to Pink #FF4D6D for "Found" to match the "Rose Pink" primary color, and Crimson for "Lost".
